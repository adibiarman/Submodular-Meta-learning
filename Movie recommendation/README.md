# submodular meta-learning
Movie recommendation application


## Requirements
The main code file changing_k_movie_recom.m can be run in matlab.
the data Summarydata.mat, and functions f_a_T_ind.m , f_total_ind.m, lazygreedy_ind.m needed for running code.



## Training
The training is between 45 to 308.
for changing k you should change line 49-51
for changing l you should change line 53-55
## Evaluation
