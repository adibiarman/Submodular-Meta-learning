# submodular meta-learning

Ride Share optimization

## Requirements
The main code file ridesharevaryk.c and ridesharevaryl.c
for changing k you should change line 1156 1160
for changing l you should change line 1164  1170
the files col1.txt and col2.txt are the dataset. rngs.c rv.c random.c used in the code.
for recovering two stage plot uncomment in ridesharevaryl.c: 
1642, 1411-1418, 1637,1638, 1536,1537
there is make file that must be run before each change

## Training
line 1247 to 1270 is for training
## Evaluation
line 1270 to 1370 is for test
we provide parameters in the paper.
## Results
we include all the results in paper. 
the last data generated by algorithms can be used by createfigurerideshare_varyk_withrandom
,createfigurecvaryl_withrandom, and createfiguretwostage to create the figures in the paper.
